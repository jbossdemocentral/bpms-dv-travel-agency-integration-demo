JBoss BPM Suite and JBoss DataVirt Travel Agency Integration Demo
===========================================================
This is an online employee travel booking process project. It contains multiple web services for looking up data for the process
and rules to calculate pricing. Furthermore, there are several tasks that can be activated to evaluate pricing and to review the
final booking data before completing the booking. Updated data results can be viewed directly in JBoss BPM Suite BAM Dashboards.

The backing services make use of disparate data sources integrated and exposed as services for use in this project.

2. Add products installs directory.

3. Copy Dockerfile and .dockerignore files from support/docker directory to the project root.

4. Build demo image

	```
	docker build -t jbossdemocentral/bpms-dv-travel-agency-integration-demo .
	```
5. Start demo container

	```
	docker run -it -p 9990 -p 9999:9999 -p 8080:8080 -p 31000:31000 -p 10090:10090 -p 10099:10099 -p 8180:8180 jbossdemocentral/bpms-dv-travel-agency-integration-demo
	```
